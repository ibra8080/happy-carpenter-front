### GitHub **Issues**

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

An improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **Issues** tracker on your GitHub repository.
To access your Issues, click on the "Issues" tab at the top of your repository.
Alternatively, use this link: https://github.com/ibra8080/happycarpenter/issues

If using the Issues tracker for your bug management, you can simplify the documentation process.
Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue without having to first save the screenshot locally,
then uploading into your project.

You can add labels to your issues (`bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s).

Once you've sorted the issue, you should then "Close" it.

When showcasing your bug tracking for assessment, you can use the following format:

## Unfixed Bugs

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

> [!NOTE]  
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
